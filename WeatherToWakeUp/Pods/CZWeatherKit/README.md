CZWeatherKit is a simple, extensible weather library for iOS and OS X that allows for easy downloading of weather data from various weather services. CZWeatherKit is extremely lightweight and requires no external dependencies. 

CZWeatherKit started as way to simplify weather API requests for [Sol°](https://github.com/comyarzaheri/Sol), a simple open-source iOS weather app ([App Store Link](http://appstore.com/Sol°)). The README will be updated when CZWeatherKit has been integrated back into Sol° so you can see what it looks like in a completed app.

# Getting Started

### Cocoa Pods

Add the following to your Podfile:

```ruby
    platform :ios, '7.0'
    pod "CZWeatherKit"
```

and run `pod install`. If you're not using Cocoa Pods, add the `CZWeatherKit` directory to your project (but you should probably consider using Cocoa Pods).

### Documentation

Documentation is available on [Cocoa Docs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/CZWeatherKit).


### Requirements

CZWeatherKit has only been tested on iOS 7 and OS X 10.9, but the library avoids using newer Cocoa/Cocoa Touch API so it may work on older deployment targets. 

### Supported Weather Services

CZWeatherKit currently supports the following weather services:
  * [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/)
  * [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/API)
  * [Forecast.io](https://developer.forecast.io)
  * [World Weather Online](https://developer.worldweatheronline.com)
  
Some weather services require an API key while others do not. Consult the documentation for the weather API you would like to use. Additional services can be added (somewhat) easily by adopting the `CZWeatherService` protocol. See the 'Adding New Services' section of the README.

### Climacons

`CZWeatherCondition` objects have a `climaconCharacter` property that contains an appropriate climacon character mapping for the weather condition description. The [Climacons Font](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/font/) is a font set created by [Adam Whitcroft](http://adamwhitcroft.com/) featuring various weather-related icons. In order to use the `climaconCharacter` property, download the Climacons font and add it to your project. The following example illustrates how to use the character in a `UILabel`:

```objective-c
    ...

    CZWeatherCondition *condition = ... // Pretend we have this!

    UILabel *label = [[UILabel alloc]initWithFrame:<your_frame>];
    label.font = [UIFont fontWithName:CLIMACON_FONT size:<your_font_size>];
    label.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%c", condition.climaconCharacter];
    
    ...
    
```

You can also check out the iOS example project to see a few more examples.

# Architecture

### Classes and Protocols

| Classes                        | Description
|:--------------------------------|:---------------
|`CZWeatherRequest`              | Handles requests to weather service API. 
|`CZWeatherLocation`             | Represents the location to request weather data for.
|`CZWeatherCondition`            | Represents the weather conditions at a specific moment in time.
|`CZWundergroundService`         | Service class for interacting with the Weather Underground API.
|`CZOpenWeatherMapService`       | Service class for interacting with the Open Weather Map API.
|`CZForecastioService`           | Service class for interacting with the Forecast.io API.
|`CZWorldWeatherOnlineService`   | Service class for interacting with the World Weather Online API.

| Protocols                      | Description
|:--------------------------------|:---------------
|`CZWeatherService`              | Declares an interface for weather service objects to implement
    
### Creating Requests    

Weather services differ in the variety of locations they support. For example, Wunderground allows you to query by City/State, City/Country, Zipcode, Latitude/Longitude, and IP address. Open Weather Map only allows you to query by City/State, City/Country, Latitude/Longitude. When performing requests
to a service, ensure that the query type is supported.

Requests carry with them a detail level. A detail level loosely defines how much information you wish to retrieve for the request, but the meaning can vary for each service. For example, when requesting forecast data from Wunderground, a detail level of `CZWeatherRequestLightDetail` will retrieve a 3-day forecast and `CZWeatherRequestFullDetail` will retrieve a 10-day forecast. When requesting forecast data from Open Weather Map, a detail level of `CZWeatherRequestLightDetail` will retrieve an hourly forecast and `CZWeatherRequestFullDetail` will retrieve a daily forecast.

### Adding New Services

Services can be added somewhat painlessly to CZWeatherKit. To be a weather service, a class should adopt the `CZWeatherService` protocol. Weather service objects separate URL generation/response parsing from performing actual requests. This allows new weather services to be added without any changes to the rest of the CZWeatherKit's API. If you would like to contribute to this project by adding new weather services, please take a look at both `CZWundergroundService` and `CZOpenWeatherMapService`.

# Testing

The unit tests for the project aren't all-encompassing and are somewhat lacking. If you would like to add unit tests, that would be appreciated. 

The project is also being tested on the continuous integration service [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org). You can check the build history [here](https://travis-ci.org/CZWeatherKit/CZWeatherKit).

# Contributing and Terms

If you would like to contribute to this project, please try to follow the coding style of the rest of the project. Also, I would appreciate if you add unit tests for anything you add (especially new services!).
Last but no least, these are the general terms:

* The project is under the BSD license.
* If this project results in your production app exploding users' phones, sorry I'm not liable :confused:. Also, please post an issue if it does.
